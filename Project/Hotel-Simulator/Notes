*** BUGS & IMPROVEMENTS ***
> room.displayInfo() -> make it only print once per type and display how many rooms are there and available (only for staff to see)
> Not adding the 'Add/remove room' option for staff. I mean really? A staff adding/removing a hotel room willy-nilly?
> Maybe make a unique guest account, but it's weird to make a guest register before booking
> guest checkout payment
